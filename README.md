# Polynomial Calculator Application

This project aims to create a user interface application designed to function as a polynomial calculator. The application will be capable of performing various operations involving polynomials, providing users with an intuitive way to manipulate and compute polynomial expressions.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop an application with a user-friendly interface that can effectively carry out operations on polynomials. Through this application, users will be able to perform tasks such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of polynomial expressions. The project seeks to provide a convenient tool for individuals working with polynomials in fields such as mathematics, engineering, and science.

## Use cases
The application is opened:
⦁ The main method from the Controller class located in the Controller package is executed.
⦁ Enter the first polynomial in the first textField and the second polynomial in the second textField.
⦁ Press the "+" button for addition, "-" for subtraction, "x" for multiplication, "/" for division.
⦁ The result will be displayed in the third textField labeled "result".

## Conclusion
For further developments, the division function should be implemented, and the calculator should be made capable of working with real and complex coefficients.
